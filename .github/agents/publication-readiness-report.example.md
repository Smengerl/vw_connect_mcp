## Recommendations

### Completed ✅
1. ✅ **License Badge Fixed** - Updated from MIT to Beer-ware

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

#### Medium Priority
2. **Package Metadata for PyPI** - Add setup.py or pyproject.toml
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "weconnect-mcp"
   version = "1.0.0"
   description = "MCP Server for Volkswagen WeConnect"
   ```

3. **Version Tagging** - Create v1.0.0 tag when ready
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial public release"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

4. **GitHub Release** - Use GitHub Releases with changelog
   - Create release notes
   - List features and improvements
   - Include installation instructions

#### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
5. **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions for automated testing
   ```yaml
   name: Tests
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Run tests
           run: ./scripts/test.sh --skip-slow
   ```
