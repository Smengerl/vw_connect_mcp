**NOTE**: Vehicle commands (start_charging, stop_charging) only work when the vehicle is parked and plugged in.

**STEP 1 – CURRENT VEHICLE STATE**
1. Get charging status using get_charging_status
   - Is the vehicle currently plugged in? (is_plugged_in)
   - Current SOC and target SOC
   - Current charging power (kW)
2. Get battery status using get_battery_status
   - Current range estimate
3. Get vehicle position using get_vehicle_position
   - Needed for weather and electricity price lookup

**STEP 2 – WEATHER FORECAST**
4. Get weather forecast for the vehicle location:
   - Overnight low temperature (between now and {target_departure_time})
   - Temperature at {target_departure_time}
   - Precipitation (rain, snow, frost)
5. Estimate weather impact on battery range:
   - Below 0°C: range reduced by ~25–35 %, battery needs preconditioning
   - 0–10°C: range reduced by ~10–20 %
   - Above 20°C (with AC): range reduced by ~5–10 %
6. Determine if windows are closed and vehicle secured (get_physical_status)
   - Open windows in cold/wet weather = additional climate load

**STEP 3 – ELECTRICITY PRICE FORECAST**
7. Fetch electricity spot prices or time-of-use tariffs for the overnight period:
   - Use location (country/region) from vehicle position
   - Search for ENTSO-E day-ahead prices, Tibber, aWATTar, or similar for the region
   - Identify cheapest 4-hour window between now and {target_departure_time}
   - Identify most expensive periods to avoid
8. Calculate cost comparison:
   - Cheapest window price per kWh
   - Average/peak price per kWh
   - Potential savings by shifting charging

**STEP 4 – REQUIRED ENERGY CALCULATION**
9. Calculate energy needed:
   - Target SOC for departure (80 % default, 100 % if long trip)
   - Weather-adjusted range target (add buffer for cold weather)
   - Energy gap = (target_soc - current_soc) × battery_capacity_kWh
   - Charging time at current power = energy_gap / charging_power_kW
10. Include preconditioning energy if temperature < 5°C (approx. 3–5 kWh extra)

**STEP 5 – OPTIMAL SCHEDULE**
11. Calculate optimal charging schedule:
    - Fit charging window into cheapest electricity period
    - Ensure charging completes at least 30 min before {target_departure_time} (for preconditioning)
    - If vehicle is already charging: assess whether to pause and restart at cheaper time
    - If not plugged in: remind user to connect cable

**STEP 6 – ACTIONS & REPORT**
12. If vehicle is plugged in and charging should start/stop now:
    - Use start_charging or stop_charging as appropriate
    - Verify with get_charging_status
13. Provide the plan:

        return f"""Proactively suggest and manage cabin preconditioning for {vehicle_id}:

**NOTE**: Climatization commands only work when the vehicle is parked (not in use).

**STEP 1 – USER CALENDAR CHECK**
1. Check the user's calendar for upcoming appointments or events in the next 4 hours:
   - Departure times, meeting locations, travel events
   - Look for keywords: "car", "drive", "pick up", address fields
   - Identify the most imminent planned departure
2. Ask the user if no calendar is available: "When do you next plan to use the vehicle?"

**STEP 2 – VEHICLE STATE**
3. Get vehicle position using get_vehicle_position
4. Get climate status using get_climate_status
   - Is climatization already running?
   - Current settings
5. Get charging status using get_charging_status (BEV/PHEV)
   - Using external power for preconditioning saves battery range

**STEP 3 – WEATHER AT DEPARTURE TIME**
6. Get weather forecast for vehicle location at planned departure time:
   - Current outside temperature
   - Temperature at planned departure
   - Precipitation: rain, snow, frost, fog, hail
   - Wind chill factor
7. Determine preconditioning need:
   - ❄️  Below 0°C: STRONGLY recommended (cabin comfort + battery warmup for BEV)
   - 🌧️  Rain/snow: Recommended (defogging, defrost)
   - ☀️  Above 28°C: Recommended (cabin cooling before entry)
   - 🟢 Mild conditions: Optional comfort improvement
8. For BEV/PHEV: preconditioning while plugged in saves significant range (up to 15%)

**STEP 4 – OPTIMAL START TIME**
9. Calculate when to start preconditioning:
   - Cold weather (<0°C): 20–30 min before departure
   - Moderate cold (0–10°C): 10–15 min before departure
   - Rain/fog: 5–10 min before departure (defogging)
   - Hot weather (>28°C): 10–15 min before departure
   - Heating speed: cabin reaches target in ~10–15 min under normal conditions

**STEP 5 – TARGET TEMPERATURE**
10. Determine optimal target temperature:
    - Standard comfort: 21°C
    - Cold weather: 22–23°C (slightly warmer for comfort)
    - Hot weather: 19–20°C (cooler for relief from heat)
    - User preference: check previous settings in climate status if available

**STEP 6 – SUGGESTION & ACTION**
11. Present suggestion to user:
    "Based on {{weather_conditions}} at {{departure_time}}, I recommend starting preconditioning at {{start_time}} to reach {{target_temp}}°C.
     {{vehicle_is_plugged_in ? 'Vehicle is plugged in – preconditioning will use grid power (no range loss).' : 'Note: Vehicle is not plugged in – preconditioning uses ~3–5 kWh of battery.'}}
    Shall I start it automatically?"

12. If user confirms (or if this is automated):
    - Use start_climatization with target temperature
    - For frost/fog: also start_window_heating
    - Verify with get_climate_status

1. Get energy status using get_energy_status
   - Current SOC / fuel level and estimated range
   - Vehicle type (electric / hybrid / combustion)
2. Get vehicle position using get_vehicle_position (starting point)

**STEP 2 – CALENDAR & TIME CONSTRAINTS**
3. Check user's calendar for constraints related to this trip:
   - Does the destination match a calendar event? → hard arrival deadline
   - Return trip? → note any scheduled return time
   - Meeting duration at destination?
4. If no calendar event matches, ask: "Is there a specific arrival time you need to meet?"

**STEP 3 – ROUTE & TRAFFIC ANALYSIS**
5. Calculate primary route to {destination}:
   - Total distance
   - Current estimated driving time (live traffic)
   - Toll roads, motorway vs. country road mix
6. Get traffic forecast for the next 1–4 hours:
   - Rush hour patterns for departure area
   - Any reported incidents or roadworks
   - Optimal departure window to minimise travel time
7. Calculate 2–3 alternative routes with time and distance comparison

**STEP 4 – ENERGY FEASIBILITY**
8. Determine if current range is sufficient for the trip:
   - For BEV/PHEV: estimate consumption (motorway ~20% more than city)
   - Apply weather correction (cold/heat, wind)
   - Safety buffer: always target ≥ 15–20% SOC / ≥ 50 km range on arrival
9. If range is insufficient:
   - For electric: find fast charging stations (CCS/CHAdeMO) along route
     → Search PlugShare, ABRP, or similar for stations within 5 km of route
     → Select optimal stop (minimise detour + charging time)
     → Calculate required charging time for enough range to reach destination
   - For combustion/hybrid: find petrol stations along route

**STEP 5 – PRE-DEPARTURE CHARGING (if needed)**
10. If vehicle is plugged in and more charge is needed:
    - Calculate how much additional SOC is required
    - Estimate charging time at current power
    - If plugged in, check whether to charge more before departure
    - Use start_charging if needed, with verification via get_charging_status

**STEP 6 – OPTIMAL DEPARTURE TIME**
11. Calculate the optimal departure window:
    - Earliest: when sufficient charge reached (if charging) + 5 min preconditioning buffer
    - Latest: arrival deadline − driving time − weather buffer − charging stop time (if needed)
    - Best: balances traffic avoidance, charge level, and time constraints
12. If cold (<5°C): add preconditioning start 15–20 min before optimal departure

   a) **Environmental/Low Emission Zones (LEZ/Umweltzone)**:
      - Search for "{destination} Umweltzone" or "{destination} low emission zone"
      - Determine required Euro standard (Euro 4, 5, 6)
      - Check dates/times when restrictions apply
      - Check if exemptions apply (electric, hybrid, new vehicles)

   b) **Zero Emission Zones (ZEZ / EV-only zones)**:
      - Search for "{destination} zero emission zone" or "{destination} EV only zone"
      - Check if purely electric vehicles have advantages
      - Check if PHEVs qualify (depends on electric range requirements)
      - Increasingly common in city centres: check Oslo, Amsterdam, London, etc.

   c) **Congestion Charge / City Toll**:
      - Search for "{destination} congestion charge" or "{destination} Citymaut"
      - Check charge amount, operating hours
      - EV exemptions (London, Stockholm, Milan, etc.)
      - Daily, weekly caps

   d) **Diesel Driving Bans (Dieselfahrverbote)**:
      - Relevant for German cities (Stuttgart, Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich, etc.)
      - Check affected streets or entire zones
      - Euro 5 diesel bans in some cities

   e) **Temporary Restrictions**:
      - Event-based restrictions (large events, races, markets)
      - Construction-related road closures
      - Weather-related emergency restrictions

**STEP 3 – VEHICLE COMPLIANCE CHECK**
4. Cross-reference vehicle details with zone requirements:
   - Does the vehicle meet the emission standard?
   - Is an EV exemption applicable?
   - Does PHEV qualify (check electric range requirement, typically ≥ 50 km)
   - Are there sticker/vignette requirements (German Umweltplakette: green = Euro 4+)

**STEP 4 – COST IMPACT**
5. Calculate cost impact:
   - Congestion/city toll: €{{amount}} per entry or per day
   - Parking surcharges for non-compliant vehicles (where applicable)
   - Fine risk if restrictions violated (mention as risk, not to encourage violation)
   - EV benefits: free/reduced city tolls, free parking in some zones

**STEP 5 – ROUTE ALTERNATIVES**
6. If restrictions apply:
   - Identify alternative routes that avoid restricted zones
   - Suggest park-and-ride options on the zone boundary

**NOTE**: This prompt is for BEV/PHEV vehicles only. Commands only execute when vehicle is parked.

**STEP 1 – CURRENT STATE**
1. Get charging status using get_charging_status
   - Current SOC, target SOC, charging state
   - Charging power (kW), charge mode
   - Is vehicle currently charging?
2. Get battery status using get_battery_status
   - SOC percentage, estimated range
3. Get vehicle info using get_vehicle_info
   - Model, year → used to look up battery specs
4. Get vehicle position using get_vehicle_position
   - Needed for weather (temperature affects battery chemistry)

**STEP 2 – WEATHER & TEMPERATURE**
5. Get current temperature at vehicle location:
   - Below 10°C: lithium-ion batteries charge less efficiently, higher internal resistance
   - Below 0°C: charging at high rates can cause lithium plating (permanent damage)
   - Above 35°C: accelerated degradation during charging
6. Assess if temperature-related charging caution is needed

**STEP 3 – BATTERY HEALTH RESEARCH**
7. Look up battery health guidelines for this specific vehicle:
   - Search for "{{manufacturer}} {{model}} battery longevity tips" or "{{model}} charging recommendations"
   - Standard best practices for lithium-ion:
     * Daily charge target: 80% (not 100%) for regular use
     * 100% only for long trips (and drive soon after reaching 100%)
     * Avoid staying at 100% for extended periods (>2 h)
     * Avoid deep discharge below 10–15%
     * Preferred daily operating range: 20–80%
   - Vehicle-specific: some models have built-in buffer (e.g. Tesla reports 100% but actual is ~95%)
8. Check manufacturer-specific recommendations (e.g. VW ID series: "home charging" mode targets 80%)

**STEP 4 – CURRENT BEHAVIOUR ASSESSMENT**
9. Assess current charging settings vs. best practice:
   - Current target SOC vs. recommended daily target (80%)
   - Is vehicle often charged to 100%? (infer from current settings)
   - Charging speed: AC (gentle, preferred for daily) vs. DC fast charging (limit when possible)
   - Is vehicle left plugged in at 100% for long periods?
10. Note any active charging if running (and current power level)

**STEP 5 – USAGE CONTEXT**
11. Ask or infer from calendar/context:
    - Is the user taking a long trip soon? → 100% charge may be justified
    - Normal daily commute (<100 km)? → 80% is optimal
    - Vehicle parked for >24 h? → avoid high SOC
12. If charging is currently active and target SOC > 80% with no long trip planned:
    - Suggest reducing target SOC (user action in vehicle app, as direct SOC target setting
      may not be available via this API)

**STEP 6 – CHARGING RATE OPTIMISATION**
13. Assess current charging power:
    - For overnight charging: slower AC charging (7–11 kW) preferred over fast DC
    - DC fast charging generates more heat → use sparingly
    - If available: check if vehicle supports reduced charging current setting
14. Temperature-based rate advice:
    - Below 0°C: recommend preconditioning battery before charging (start_climatization)
    - Above 35°C: consider charging at cooler time of day

**STEP 7 – REPORT & RECOMMENDATIONS**
